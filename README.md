# DarkSome a DARK theme switcher for macOS

Apple's new macOS 10.14 codename Mojave has a nice dark theme, but to change it you need to go click trough multiple screens to change the theme.

To switch fast and simple I created a Menu Bar App for this. It does exactly what you see below with a mouse click.

To switch theme, click left, to exit click right on the moon/sun icon.
